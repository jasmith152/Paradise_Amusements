<p align="left">RIDE AND MIDWAY SAFETY<br /><br />

<strong>Safety is our number one priority at Paradise Amusements, Inc.</strong><br /><br />

Our rides are inspected at every setup by our maintenance team and daily, by our ride operators. On a weekly basis all rides are also inspected by local and state safety inspectors and annually, by our insurance company's inspectors and state inspectors.<br /><br />

It is rare to find anything wrong with our rides, but when we do, it is fixed correctly before the ride is put back into operation.<br /><br />

Our winter quarters are located in Ocala Florida, where we work year round to improve the appearance and safety of our rides. <br /><br />

Our ride operators are well trained in all aspects of their particular ride including setup procedure, inspection and operation.<br /><br />

All ride operators and employees of Paradise Amusements, Inc. are drug tested to ensure safety of our guests. </p></td>
